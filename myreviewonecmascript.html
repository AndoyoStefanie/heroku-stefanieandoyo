  <h1 id="headline" style="font-size: 25px;"> ➢ Realizations and insights about ECMAScript & JavaScript</h1>

  <ul>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">◦ My realization of the history of ECMAScript is that it was created in the past by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape
  Communications. At first it was originally known as Mocha, which later on was renamed to LiveScript since the word “Live” was better
  for marketing. It was made in just 10 days but it proved to be functional, although it was still a draft during that time.<br>
  
  <br>
  ◦ Netscape’s Mocha was actually aimed by its developers to turn the web into a full-blown application platform. This language was conceived as a scripting language for the Web for both client and server side. It was then quickly re-positioned as a Web “companion.”<br>

<br>
◦ ECMAScript is a general-purpose programming language, which is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web. It is now being used for writing server applications and services using Node.js.<br>

<br>

◦ The video materials shown made me realize JavaScript’s fascinating history. It is actually called vanilla because people simply do not like
this language due to it being bland or boring. As they say, it is one of the most hated languages on the planet for several reasons. However,
we cannot deny the fact that it is still functional and it allows us to freely mix and match object-oriented, procedural, and practical
paradigms in one language.</p>

<p  style="color: white;">"JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java.
  The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
  The standard of scripting languages like JavaScript is ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a Standard for scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript, etc."<br>
